## AGENCY Policies (please initial to acknowledge)

* The listed contact will be notified by email when casework is complete. All physical and digital evidence must be picked up by the case agent or their designee within 30 days of email notification. No cases may be received from an agency until all completed cases are picked up.

* All digital evidence (forensic images, extractions, and reports) is the responsibility of the case agent once released. Only a summary report will be stored long-term by AGENCY. The case agent must ensure the forensic images and extractions are maintained until a case is adjudicated so they are available for court purposes or any further processing deemed necessary.

* All digital evidence with the exception of a summary report will be deleted by AGENCY 30 days after it is released. It is the responsibility of the case agent to, within the 30 days, ensure the data was successfully transferred and is securely stored according to their department policies.

* AGENCY strongly recommends the case agent create at least one backup of all digital evidence.
