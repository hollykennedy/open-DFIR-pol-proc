# Welcome to _The Open DFIR Policies and Procedures Manual_!

</p>We're glad you're here. This project aims to develop a model policies and procedures manual for digital forensics and incident response (DFIR). The [project founder](https://github.com/hollykennedy) is in law enforcement, but ideally this project will grow to accommodate other DFIR professionals. Currently, all contributors to this project must be active members of the [Digital Forensics Discord](https://discord.com/invite/digitalforensics). If you have any questions or comments about the project, please email (contact@hollykennedy.me).</p>
