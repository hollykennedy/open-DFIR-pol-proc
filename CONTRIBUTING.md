# Welcome to _The Open DFIR Policies and Procedures Manual_!

We're glad you're here. This project aims to develop a model policies and procedures manual for digital forensics and incident response (DFIR). The project founder is in law enforcement, but ideally this project will grow to accommodate other DFIR professionals. Currently, all contributors to this project must be active members of the [Digital Forensics Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/digitalforensics). If you have any questions or comments about the project, please email [contact@hollykennedy.me](mailto:contact@hollykennedy.me).
