add something about how evidence should be retained for the length of the statute of limitations for the crime itself. For instance, if crime is a homicide where there is no statute of limitations, then evidence is retained forever. If it's a lesser crime with, for example, a 7 year statue of limitations, then hold on to the evidence for 7 years and then it can be disposed of.
