# Digital Evidence Policy

* Digital evidence in the possession of AGENCY should be backed up as soon as possible, preferably in a separate physical location. Cloud backups are permissible if built for law enforcement purposes.

* All forensic images should be MD5 hashed upon acquisition. Hash values should be matched to ensure evidence integrity. If a hash cannot be matched, the fact should be documented along with the hypothesized source of the mismatch.

* Make note of digital evidence that cannot be MD5 hashed (such as mobile device extractions). While mobile device extractions cannot be hashed, graphical images from the extraction should have consistent hashes. Research the mobile device prior to extraction, there are some devices that allow for expandable storage (i.e. microSD), these should be imaged separately. 

* If forensic images or extractions originally produced by AGENCY are returned to AGENCY for further processing, the MD5 hash value on record with AGENCY should be verified against the data resubmitted.
