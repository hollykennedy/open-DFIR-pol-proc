# Digital Evidence Policy

* Digital evidence in the possession of AGENCY should be backed up as soon as possible, preferably in a separate physical location. Cloud backups are permissible if built for law enforcement purposes.

* All forensic images should be MD5 hashed upon acquisition. Hash values should be matched to ensure evidence integrity. If a hash cannot be matched, the fact should be documented along with the hypothesized source of the mismatch.

* Digital evidence that cannot be MD5 hashed (such as mobile device extractions)...

* If forensic images or extractions originally produced by AGENCY are returned to AGENCY for further processing, the MD5 hash value on record with AGENCY should be verified against the data resubmitted.
