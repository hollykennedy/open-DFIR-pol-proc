# On-Scene Digital Evidence Procedures

**Note: Digital evidence may very easily be altered or destroyed by improper handling. If there are any doubts about what course of action should be taken in collecting devices, please contact AGENCY for on-call assistance.**

## General Guidelines

* Suspects and their accomplices can destroy digital evidence very quickly and should not be permitted to use any electronic devices. If data must be accessed on-scene, these persons must be permitted only to direct others in the operation of the devices and not allowed to personally handle them.

* In general, initial responders should leave devices in the state in which they were found. That is, devices found on should be left on, those found off should be left off, and any programs running on the devices should be left running.

* Modern electronic devices often have security protections beyond passcodes alone. Locked devices may become more difficult or impossible to unlock as time passes, if too many unlock attempts are made, or if power to the device is interrupted. Devices found powered on should be transported while connected to a power source whenever possible (e.g., portable power bank).

* Devices found unlocked should be maintained in an unlocked state to preserve evidence by changing the device security settings or by using hardware such as mouse jigglers. All such actions should be documented.

* If legal authorization permits, biometrics may be used to unlock devices. The window of opportunity for these access methods is often relatively short, so they should be used as soon as possible.

* In order to prevent the remote destruction of digital evidence, mobile devices should be prevented from communicating with cell or wifi networks. This is ideally done by securing the device in a Faraday bag, but may be accomplished by enabling airplane mode and disabling Bluetooth (not accessible on all devices), or by physically taking the device away from known wifi networks and removing the SIM card (least preferred option -- may jeopardize future access to data).

* Always ask for passcodes or passwords to devices and online services and look in places they may be written down. Access to valid credentials is often a substantial timesaver for evidence processing and is in some cases the only way to gain access. If the owner is not present or uncooperative, other subjects may know the credentials or where to find them.

* Be aware of devices that other devices may act as access credentials for devices or services (e.g., smartwatches currently being worn or two-factor identification hardware).
